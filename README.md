There are 3 files using MRJob trying to answer the questions from the companies dataset
1. The file company.py gets for each company the date of min value, and the date of max value.
2. The file stable_companies.py gets the list of companies that have always improved their value.
3. The file black_day gets the day that has the max quantity of companies with the lowest value of their price. 

In order to run a file you can use the following command ```python file_name.py input.txt```
